                  Vlogging is a fantastic way to document your life, business,

            <p>
              I started vlogging on a whim. No goal, no direction, and no
              equipment. I just wanted to do this thing people called
              “vlogging”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Heck, when I approached my wife about starting a vlog, she
              literally said, “Do you have to?”
            </p>
            <p>
              It was hard. I showed up for 78 days, every single day, and
              produced a video for my YouTube channel. A daily show while having
              a family, a full-time job, and working on moving to another
              country.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually I moved to a weekly schedule. I began to develop
              techniques, things to save time during filming and editing. I
              planned, I made mistakes, and I pressed on.
            </p>
            <p>I didn’t even know if it would be worth it.</p>
            <p>Spoiler: It was.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Vlogging is part of my life now,</strong> it’s simply part
              of what I do, and the personal benefits have been incredible.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've lived all around the world with my wife and two daughters,
              and I have a{' '}

            When I first started vlogging, I had no idea what I was supposed to
            record.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, <strong>starting was the hardest part.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            I claimed I was trying to figure out my style, the kind of content
            I’d be making, how to get great quality…but actually, I wasn’t
            really doing anything but procrastinating.
          </p>
          <p>Why is it so hard to get started with a vlog?</p>
          <p>I can think of a number of reasons:</p>

          <ul className="mb-4">
            <li>Lack of confidence</li>
            <li>Lack of ideas (or too many!)</li>
            <li>Thinking you need specific gear</li>
            <li>Thinking you need a specific type of personality</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I could go on. Seriously, I had to stop myself from writing out
            dozens more bullet points.
          </p>
          <p>That’s what held me back.</p>
          <p>
            I was watching video after video, trying to figure out how to match
            styles of my favorite vloggers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I had no idea where to even begin.</strong> I had no idea
            what my goals were, or why I even wanted to get started in the first
            place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually I did get started. Now here I am, many years later, and
            the process of vlogging has become part of my weekly routine.
