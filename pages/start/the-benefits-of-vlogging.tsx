        <p>
          The idea of vlogging might sound great and all, but once you start
          adding up the investment of time and possibly money, the question of
          “is this even worth it?” will inevitably arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question of return on investment is a good one to explore. Why
          bother starting something if it has no tangible benefits?
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are a few of the benefits and returns that I (and others) have
          seen as a result of starting a vlog:
        </p>

        <Heading level="h2">1. A vlog builds trust with your audience</Heading>

        <p>
          Whether you’re building a business, growing a brand, or just wanting
          to do something as an individual, arguably{' '}
          <strong>the most important thing you need is trust.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          From a business standpoint, you want to sell more products, get more
          customers or clients, and stay in business (and hopefully grow!). If
          nobody knows who you are or has any confidence in your business, what
          makes you think they’ll actually buy from you?
        </p>
        <p>
          Anything you’re wanting to do starts with trust. Companies spend
          thousands, even millions of dollars on advertising, marketing, and
          branding to build a sense of awareness and familiarity, to increase
          trust from their potential customers.
        </p>

        <Blockquote>
          From the moment we are born, we are learning who we can trust.

          2. A vlog gives you something to look back at
        </Heading>

        <p>May 22, 2016. The day my daughter Melody was born.</p>
        <p>
          From a vlogging perspective, it was a disaster. I had recorded nearly
          the entire thing: leaving the house, driving to the hospital, getting
          settled, the little breaks I would take to recap what was going on, to
          finally meeting our new daughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recorded our first daughter Rylynn meeting Melody for the first
          time. I recorded family and friends coming in, the tears and laughter
          and joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I went to edit together the footage, I discovered that the SD card
          was corrupted. I had lost everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dealing with lost footage is a story for another time, but not to be
          daunted, I pulled out my iPhone and recorded a short several-minute
          clip in the hospital room with Melody. I uploaded it and went back to
          my family.
        </p>

        <span className="text-yellow-400 text-shadow-sm">
          A vlog is little pieces of history
        </span>{' '}
        just waiting to be remembered.
      </Massive>
      <CopyBlock>
        <p>
          This is just one of thousands of memories I can rewatch and relive
          whenever I want. In 2016 my family and I moved from California to
          Ireland, one of the most significant life changes I’ve ever
          experienced.{' '}
        </p>

        <p>
          Because I was vlogging, I have videos of final moments with family,
          little subtleties and memories I might have forgotten later. I’ve even
          gone back to watch the video where we drove to the airport many times
          since then.
        </p>

        <p>
          These are only a few examples of tangible, watchable memories that you
          can capture and keep with you forever.
        </p>

        <Heading level="h2">3. A vlog keeps you creative</Heading>

        <p>
          If you decide to produce a vlog on a consistent basis (more on that
          later), sooner or later you’ll start to feel like you’ve already said
          everything you have to say and you’ve shown everything you have to
          show.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a remarkably common feeling, and I assure you unless you
          record and upload every single second of your life or subject matter,
          you’ll never run out.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Creativity is required when it comes to vlogging.</strong>{' '}
          Discovering your voice, your style, and even the type of content you
          want to make requires a level of creativity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Forcing yourself to create something new on a regular basis keeps you
          on your creative toes. It gives you the opportunity to introduce new
          concepts and challenges for yourself, or deliver your message in a
          fresh new way to your audience.
        </p>

        <p>
          As long as you have the desire to learn and improve, starting a vlog
          may be the thing your creative muscles have been aching for.
        </p>

        <Heading level="h2">4. A vlog builds relationships</Heading>

        <p>
          One of the strangest (and coolest) moments in recents years was
          meeting up with a couple who were watchers of my vlog and were going
          to be in Dublin for their honeymoon.
        </p>

        <p>
          They reached out to me, we met up in the city for coffee, and we had a
          fantastic time.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is only one example. I’ve had great conversations with people all
          around the world because I put myself and my work out there for them
          to interact with.
        </p>

        <Blockquote>
          As you vlog,{' '}
          <strong>
            you actually start to build relationships with people online
          </strong>{' '}
          because they feel like they know you.
        </Blockquote>

        <p>
          It also improves your ability to share your life with friends and
          family who aren’t near you. When I moved with my family to Ireland in
          2016, I took my vlogging habit with me. My family in the States often
          thanks me for my videos because it helps them feel like we’re still
          connected.
        </p>

        <Heading level="h2">
          5. A vlog demonstrates your knowledge or expertise
        </Heading>

        <p>
          Finally, one of the greatest advantages of having a vlog is the
          ability to share what you know.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are more articles than I can count on why you <em>should</em> be
          sharing and teaching what you know, especially as a company or a
          brand, so I won’t get into that here.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you put your work out into the world and demonstrate you know
          what you’re talking about, you’re going to attract attention (we’ll
          talk more about attention later on).
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the best truths about a vlog is that{' '}
          <strong>a vlog can be whatever you want it to be.</strong> You don’t
          have to make it exactly how anyone else is doing it. All you need to
          do is make it your own and people who find it interesting will follow.
        </p>

        <p>
          Vlogging doesn’t automatically make you an authority on an issue, but
          it is simply a platform through which you can express your viewpoints,
          expertise, and skill. The more you show it, the more you prove it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next up I want to address some misconceptions about vlogging and why
          there’s no reason you can’t start vlogging <em>today</em>.
