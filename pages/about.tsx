          I started vlogging on a whim. No goal, no direction, and no equipment.
          I just wanted to do this thing people called “vlogging”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heck, when I approached my wife, about it, she literally said, “Do you
          have to?”
        </p>
        <p>
          It was hard. I showed up for 78 days, every single day, and produced a
          video for my YouTube channel. A daily show while having a family, a
          full-time job, and working on moving to another country.

          Eventually I moved to a weekly schedule. I began to develop
          techniques, things to save time during filming and editing. I planned,
          I made mistakes, and I pressed on.
        </p>
        <p>I didn’t even know if it would be worth it.</p>
        <p>Spoiler: It was.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Vlogging is part of my life now,</strong> it’s simply part of
          what I do, and the personal benefits have been incredible.
