        <p>
          Let’s talk about the types of cameras most commonly used by vloggers.
          Before we get started, I’d like to make a few disclaimers:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            This is not a comprehensive list of all the different types of
            vlogging cameras available, and
          </li>
          <li>None of these cameras are required to vlog</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In this section I’ll be talking about the more common cameras used in
          vlogging, the types of cameras that you might consider looking into,
          and some of the top features that make each camera a good option.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ll assume that you’re reading this page because you want to upgrade
          from using something more entry-level and{' '}
          <strong>
            you want to cut through the clutter and find a good camera without
            wasting time.
          </strong>
        </p>

        <Heading level="h2">Point-and-shoot cameras</Heading>

        <p>
          Point-and-shoot cameras are simply the most convenient way to vlog on
          a dedicated camera. These are easily portable, have low-barrier to
          entry, and usually pack a ton of features you m might not expect in
          such a small package.
        </p>

        <p>
          Vloggers like point-and-shoots because you can throw the camera in
          your pocket before heading out, or leave it on your desk to quickly
          record videos as you think of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          You might be surprised at the price tags of some of these cameras, but
          you’ll be blown away at how well these cameras perform and how long
          they last. They can be great investments if you’re serious about
          getting into video.

          alt="Sony RX100 Mark IV"
        />

        <p>
          The Sony RX100 series has been among the most popular cameras
          primarily because of its form factor, durability, and a few specific
          features that make it great for vlogging.
        </p>

        <p>
          Recent RX100 models include features such as 4K recording capability,
          120 and 240 frames-per-second recording for slow-motion clips, and a
          flip-out screen that allows you to see what’s being recorded while
          looking at it from the front.
        </p>

        <p>
          The RX100 also has a great lens system, allowing you to zoom in if you
          need to or get some of that blurry background that looks great on
          video.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a Sony RX100 Mark 4, and while it’s not the latest model, it
          still does everything I’m looking for.

        <Heading level="h3">Canon G7X Series</Heading>

        <Image
          width={1200}
          height={900}
          src="/images/pages/cameras-commonly-used-by-vloggers/canon-g7x-mii.jpg"
          alt="Canon G7X Mark II"
        />

        <p>
          Another leader in the point-and-shoot department is the Canon G7X
          Series. I remember a few years ago when almost all of the top YouTub
          creatures who were vlogging went out and bought this camera.
        </p>

        <p>
          These cameras are great value for what they provide. They are
          incredibly easy to learn, simple to handle, and very compact. Just
          like the RX100, pocketing one of these cameras for a trip or just
          moving into your other room to record is very easy.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the other perks that most of these point-and-shoots have is
          built-in image stabilization. Simply put, it takes the image that
          you’re bring in through the lens and stabilizing it to make the video
          smoother. Some cameras do this digitally and others use little
          mechanical balancing systems, but the results work out well for smooth
          video.
        </p>

        <p>
          The G7X also has a flip-out screen, another point for the on-the-go
          vlogger who wants to make sure their framing is good.
        </p>

        <p>
          The G7X series has historically been less expensive than the Sony
          RX100 series, so if you’re looking for something a bit more
          entry-level, the G7X is a great option to check out.
        </p>

        <Heading level="h2">Midrange with swappable lenses</Heading>

        <p>
          The next range of cameras you might be interested in are midrange
          cameras that give you the option of swapping out lenses, attaching
          high-quality mics, and all around may have a few more options for
          customization.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most cameras in this category are very affordable, and in many cases
          you can take any of these listed, go back a few generations, and find
          some really good options for much less than buying the latest model.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another thing to keep in mind when getting cameras with swappable
          lenses is to make sure the lenses you’re buying fit the camera and
          sensor. I won’t go into all of the technical details here, but just
          make sure any lens you buy works with the camera you have before
          purchasing it.
        </p>

        <Heading level="h3">Canon M50</Heading>

        <Image
          width={1200}
          height={900}
          src="/images/pages/cameras-commonly-used-by-vloggers/canon-m50.jpg"
          alt="Canon M50"
        />

        <p>
          The Canon M50 is a class of its own. Its smaller size makes it
          extremely portable, but the internals are also very attractive.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the biggest features this little camera has is the ability to
          shoot video in 4K. Recording at higher resolutions gives you the
          opportunity to do more with more, and for a lot of vloggers this is a
          really great selling point.
        </p>

        <p>
          If high resolution video isn’t your thing right now, you might be
          interested in the image stabilization or the revolving screen, or
          simply the fact that you can have multiple lenses for different
          settings.
        </p>

          alt="Canon 80d"
        />

        <p>
          Arguably one of the most popular entry-level DSLR cameras for vlogging
          was the Canon 60d. It had great autofocus, a flip-out screen,
          capability for external audio, and more. Several years ago it seemed{' '}
          <em>everyone</em> had this camera.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fast-forward a few years and you get the 80d, a step up from the
          point-and-shoots and a great option for vloggers who want more options
          in a single camera.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Canon 80d shoots in 1080p and has incredible autofocus, so you
          won’t have to worry too much about the settings while you’re vlogging
          on the go. A great option for the mid-range vlogging category.

        <Heading level="h2">High-End Cameras</Heading>

        <p>
          Now we enter the world of full-frame and “wow how did they pack so
          many features in there” cameras. These higher-end cameras are truly a
          class of their own. You’ll find a lot of tech and outdoor vloggers
          using these because of their incredible versatility and quality.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many of the cameras you’d find in this category are top-tier and
          provide you with an expanse of options: great autofocus, swappable
          lenses, 4K, multiple frame rates, weatherproofing, and more.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you really want to move your vlog into the next level of quality
          and aren’t too worried about the investment, these are great options.

        <Heading level="h3">Panasonic Lumix GH5</Heading>

        <Image

          alt="Panasonic Lumix GH5"
        />

        <p>
          The Panasonic Lumix GH5 was a surprise when it first launched, because
          nobody seemed to expect another camera that could jump into the waters
          with the other top-end vlogging cameras.
        </p>

        <p>
          The GH5 packs a punch with its impressively large number of features:
          4K resolution, in-body image stabilization, advanced autofocus,
          multiple levels of high frame rates, and a huge amount of features
          that wouldn’t fit here.
        </p>

        <p>
          There’s a lot going for the GH5, and it is certainly top of its class.
          The type of content I’ve seen produced on this camera varies from
          “talking head” videos in an office to jaw-dropping slackline adventure
          videos. This can certainly be your one-and-only if you wanted it to
          be.

        <p>
          Sony has been slowly but surely increasing its footprint in the photo
          and video world, and one of its best entries to date has been the Sony
          A7 series.{' '}
        </p>

        <p>
          The Sony A7S has been widely acknowledged as one of the best low-light
          options on the market, which gives you better options for location and
          timing without having to worry about grainy video quality.
        </p>

        <p>
          These cameras have all of the top-end features, including 4K, external
          audio capability, image stabilization, and even sports a full-frame
          sensor inside.
        </p>

        <p>
          The primary feature of this camera, as mentioned before, is the light
          capability. Sometimes you want to take your camera outside and you’ve
          obviously got plenty of light, but other times you might want to film
          later in the evening or inside when it’s not as bright. The A7s series
          is perfect for this type of versatility.
